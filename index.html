      <h2 style="color: orange">What's the point?</h2>
    </hgroup>
    <p>According to the dictionary, semantics refers to the meaning of a:<p>
      <ul>
      <li>word</li>
      <li>phrase</li>
      <li>sentence</li>
      <li>text</li>
      </ul>
    <p>In the world of <code>HTML</code>, the word semantics means essentially the same thing.</p>
    <p>According to an article published by Codepen in January, 2016 called <i><a href="https://codepen.io/mi-lee/post/an-overview-of-html5-semantics">An Overview of HTML5 Semantics</a></i>,"a semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and developer."
    <p>In my experience, anything that can provide clarity and accessibility is a <em>good</em> thing.</p>
    <p>My favorite thing about the web is that it connects us. But here are some other great things we can use it for:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>To learn</strong></dt>
        <dd>We've all learned how to do something by searching in Google?</dd>
        <dt><strong>To remember</strong></dt>
        <dd>What would we do without that Facebook memory of your birthday part in 2013?</dd>
        <dt><strong>To express</strong></dt>
        <dd>Whether you have a vlog or follow your favorite political candidate, the web is a great way to show who you are.</dd>
      </dl>

    <p>I express myself online through social media and by posting photos.</p>
    <p>Here's one I took in 2018.</p>

    <p>As I learn about semantics and <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> I'm not just a casual user anymore.</p>
    <p>The web will be about more than sending emails and posting photos. I'll be looking at it with the perspective of a <dfn id="def-front-end-developer">front-end developer</dfn>, which someone who creates HTML, CSS, or Java for a website for the user to see.</p>
    <p>I'm grateful for <small><mark>semantics</mark></small> because it will make learning HTML less difficult.
